1.1 - Python 3.10 is a must for the project. If you have anaconda with an another version of python, create a new environment called `python310`:

```bash
conda create -n py310 python=3.10
```

Then, activate the conda environment:

```bash
conda actiavte py310
```

1.2 - If you have python 3.10.x, continue from here:

```bash
python3.10.6 -m venv venv
```

2 - Activate venv:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3 - Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4 - In a terminal, activate venv and run (if you are using conda, activate venv after activating py310)

```bash
python backend/main.py
```

5 - In another terminal, run (if you are using conda, activate venv after activating py310)

```bash
python frontend/main.py
```

Go to your browser and access the project:

> Backend Link -> localhost:1111

> Frontend Link -> localhost:5000
